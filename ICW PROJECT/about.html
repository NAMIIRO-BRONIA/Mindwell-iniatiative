      <h2>About MindWell</h2>
      <p>
        MindWell Initiative is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting mental well-being
        through awareness, education, and support. Our mission is to reduce the stigma around mental
        health and provide accessible resources for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe mental health is just as important as physical health. Whether you're looking for
        advice, resources, or just someone to talk to—we’re here for you.
